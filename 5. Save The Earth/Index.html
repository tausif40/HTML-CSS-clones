                  why'll Saving The Earth Necessary?
               </h1>
               <p>
                  In order to save the earth, we must understand that resources that are provided by earth are
                  limited.
                  However, the of us are unaware of this fact and we are not judiciously the resources. In order
                  to
                  safeguard the existence of humans, we need to protect the earth and take care of it. All living
                  beings
                  are dependent on the earth fortheir survival and so we should use the gist of nature in a
                  thoughtful
                  way. The increase in pollution and damage caused by humans are affecting the earth so rapidly
                  that
                  it
                  is threatening our survival.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Saving earth is not merely the need of the hour but much more. The extent of degradation caused
                  by
                  humans is becoming irreparable. This is one of the reasons why all the resources are getting
                  highly
                  polluted. The change in climate is also one of the examples that are caused due to severe
                  pollution.
                  Moreover, animals, birds are getting extinct and the worlds around us are slowly approaching the
                  end.
                  Nothing could be scarier than this. Therefore, saving the earth is the primary need and we
                  should
                  make
                  conscious decisions to make the earth a better and sustainable place to live in.

                     landfill. Plus, all
                     that trash - plastic, paper, metal, and whatnot - was likely manufactured using unsustainable
